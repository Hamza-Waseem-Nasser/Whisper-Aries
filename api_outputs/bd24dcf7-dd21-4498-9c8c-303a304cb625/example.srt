1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
[SPEAKER_00] Next time you watch the news, notice how the anchors exaggerate their mouth movement.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,880
[SPEAKER_00] There's a good reason for this. Their job is to speak as clearly as possible.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,279
[SPEAKER_00] And I'll show you a simple drill to help you do that too. All you need is a pen.

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,640
[SPEAKER_00] Practicing this quick drill regularly will train you to be more articulate with little effort.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,559
[SPEAKER_00] Place a pen between your teeth and read a paragraph from a book out loud,

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,000
[SPEAKER_00] focusing on pronouncing each sound clearly. Then read it again without the pen.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,199
[SPEAKER_00] There will be a noticeable improvement in your enunciation.

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,640
[SPEAKER_00] Clearly articulating your words avoids the risk of miscommunication and lost engagement,

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,380
[SPEAKER_00] and it makes it easy and pleasurable to listen to you.

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,979
[SPEAKER_00] Do this regularly, and you'll reap the benefits.
